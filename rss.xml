These organizations, recognized as CAN-BIKE Delivery Agents, are crucial to the growth of CAN-BIKE. They provide a vital administration role, as well as the capability of making CAN-BIKE available to specific user groups or professions.</p>,<p>Delivery Agents facilitate delivery of CAN-BIKE by bringing clients, instructors and venues together, providing the promotion and administration essential to making courses available to the public. Delivery agents are responsible for ensuring that instructor and participant records are forwarded to their provincial bodies.</p>,<p>In many communities, an instructor serves as a delivery agent, performing all the administrative duties required to promote and run a course and certify participants. Elsewhere, especially in larger centres, municipal departments may be delivery agents, advertising courses, registering participants and hiring instructors. Provincial and territorial cycling associations may also be delivery agents, making the CAN-BIKE program available to their members or the public, while providing an administrative framework for instructors in the province.</p>,<h4>Here are a few examples of agencies involved in delivering CAN-BIKE:</h4>,<ul><li>cycling clubs</li><li>regional or community colleges</li><li>municipal parks and recreation departments</li><li>police services</li><li>EMS organizations</li><li>community associations</li><li>independent instructors</li><li>institutional instructors<em>Quoted from <a href="http://canbikecanada.ca/who-we-are-2/" title="">http://canbikecanada.ca/who-we-are-2/</a></em></li></ul>]]></description>
