  Rode mountain bike as a duty function.Currently a member of the Metro
  Vancouver Transit Police. Rode as a duty function, bike patrol officer until
  the unit was shut down for reasons unknown, 4 years ago. Currently a general
  duty uniform officer. My cycling qualifications are former week-end
  warrior/racer of sprint distance triathlons, a number of 1/2 marathons and one
  marathon(1991-1996). I commuted across the Greater Vancouver area, the longest
  distance was 25 kilometers one way(1996-2005). I own two bikes, a Jamis
  Durango Sport off road bike, and a Nishiki Olympic Tri A road bike. I wear a
  Catlike Kompact’o bike helmet with an Vis 360, Light & Motion lighting system
  attached to my helmet. I’m a very firm believer in bike helmets, and
  reflective vests.
